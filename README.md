# Getting Started with R and Shiny

Below is a collection of resources for getting started in R and Shiny.  They are listed roughly in the order that we would expect a motivated beginner to work through them.  

Nick put together some additional resources that he found useful during his learning process in [nicks_fav_resourses.md](https://github.com/Tychobra/r_shiny_training_material/blob/master/nicks_fav_resources.md).


### Getting Stated with R

- Download R here: https://cran.r-project.org/
- Download the free version of Rstudio here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
- Getting Started with R: https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/

  - note: I recommend skimming through the above book and trying out examples.  Skip over sections that you do not understand, and you can come back to them later.
